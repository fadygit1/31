CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - DETAILED HELP
===============================================

STEP BY STEP GUIDE:

1. FIRST TIME SETUP:
   a) Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org (choose LTS version)
   b) Restart computer after Node.js installation
   c) Double-click run.bat
   d) Wait for automatic installation (2-5 minutes)
   e) Browser opens automatically at http://localhost:5173

2. DAILY USE:
   a) Double-click run.bat
   b) Wait for browser to open
   c) Don't close the black command window
   d) Use the system normally

3. TROUBLESHOOTING:

   Problem: "Cannot find project files"
   Solution: Make sure you have either:
   - src/main.tsx in same folder as run.bat
   - project/src/main.tsx structure

   Problem: "Node.js not installed"
   Solution: Download from https://nodejs.org
   - Choose LTS (Long Term Support) version
   - Install with default settings
   - Restart computer

   Problem: "Installation failed"
   Solutions:
   1. Check internet connection
   2. Right-click run.bat → "Run as administrator"
   3. Temporarily disable antivirus
   4. Try different network/WiFi

   Problem: Browser doesn't open automatically
   Solution: Open browser manually and go to:
   http://localhost:5173

   Problem: run.bat opens and closes immediately
   Solution: 
   1. Run check.bat to see what's wrong
   2. Run install.bat to fix dependencies
   3. Make sure all files are in correct location

4. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
   - Windows 7 or newer
   - Node.js 16 or newer
   - 2GB RAM minimum
   - 500MB free disk space
   - Internet connection (first time only)

5. FILE STRUCTURE:
   The system works with either structure:
   
   Structure A (files in same folder):
   your-folder/
   ├── run.bat
   ├── src/
   ├── package.json
   └── other files...
   
   Structure B (files in project subfolder):
   your-folder/
   ├── run.bat
   └── project/
       ├── src/
       ├── package.json
       └── other files...

6. ADVANCED TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - Use check.bat to diagnose all issues
   - Use install.bat to reinstall dependencies
   - All files are now in English to avoid encoding issues
   - System auto-detects project location

All batch files are now completely in English to prevent
any character encoding issues with Arabic text!
